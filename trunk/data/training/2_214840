I finally got lm_sensors working. Took a little while. Question though: What is the -12V and the -5V volts when you run &quot;sensors&quot;? I know the +3.3V, +5V, +12V are the voltages for your power supply and it should always be right at that number.Is there a good Linux application that can monitor and tell you the CPU + motherboard temperature?<a href="http://secure.netroedge.com/~lm78/index.html" target="_blank">lm_sensors</a>gkrellm tooDon't worry about the negative voltages. The voltage is measured from the ground to the signal instead of the other way around. The following websire might be of help: <a href="http://www.pcguide.com/ref/power/sup/funcVoltages-c.html" target="_blank">http://www.pcguide.com/ref/power/sup...oltages-c.html</a>gkrellm is just a gui front-end for lm_sensors, it doesn't monitor your temperatures directly. you'll need both if you want to use gkrellm to view your hardware sensors.
