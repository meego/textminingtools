Hi,
<br />
I just came across strange problem. After upgrade from about 2 months old 
<br />
&quot;testing&quot; sarge to current &quot;stable&quot; sarge I noticed there remain 3 
<br />
&quot;upgradeable&quot; packages:
<br />

<br />
harden-environment  0.1.17 -&gt; 0.1.17
<br />
python-pyopenssl  0.6-2 -&gt; 0.6-2
<br />
python-twisted  1.3.0-8 -&gt; 1.3.0-8
<br />

<br />
It is bit funny, because no matter how many times I try to upgrade them (to 
<br />
same version as they are now), apt wants to upgrade them. It is quite 
<br />
annoying, because apticron keeps spamming me with pending upgrades ;o(
<br />

<br />
Is there some solution other than remove/install?
<br />

<br />
Thanks

&gt; Remove those binaries from your /var/cache/apt/archives/.  Either
<br />
&gt; remove it manaully, or do something like apt-get clean.
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt; The problem is that from the move from the old to the new
<br />
&gt; archive, they got a new md5sum, because they're now the same as
<br />
&gt; on debian.  And apt doesn't download them again, but does say
<br />
&gt; that it needs to be reinstalled.
<br />

<br />
Thanks a lot, apt-get clean &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade does the job.
