I have those from easyurpmi.zarb.org, but first, for example, I installed aMSN, but it's 0.94 version. Today, I found OpenOffice 2, but not the last version. Also I have Firefox 1.0.6, but I don't know if it's the same that 1.5.0.6.<br />
What do I need to update them (or upgrade, I don't know how you call it, my OS is in spanish<img src="http://linuxquestions.cachefly.net/images/questions/images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Big Grin" class="inlineimg" /> )? or where can I find other repositories?Better ask on Mandriva forum.
