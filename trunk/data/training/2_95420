Oh it was giving me time so I thought it is different. It worked...I used immediately option.In the Gnome I was able to autohide the taskbar while in the KDE I am unable to find the option any where?<b>Right-Click the taskbar, Select &quot;Configure Panel&quot;. Once you're there, select &quot;Hiding&quot;. Select the options you want from there. Good Luck!</b>
