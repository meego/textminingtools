Do you mean after a month of burn-in?  Or are there new projects coming
<br />
to fruition then, maybe a release of some sort? We generally give them 1 month out
<br />
in staging, 2 months as a backup fail over, then move them to primary.
<br />
Currently, the plan is to run the web servers as debian 32 with a biarch
<br />
chroot only for iptables, the database servers as debian 32 with a biarch chroot 
<br />
for iptables and a pure64 chroot running postgresql.  I've gotten both of these up 
<br />
over the weekend and initial regression tests are going smoothly.

No, I mean that Debian is not mature on amd64 and I would not run
<br />
something which is not mature on a production system.
<br />

<br />

<br />
I'm hoping to have a working, generally-available development
<br />
environment by then.

Ok, you seem to have thought about how you are doing things, at

least. :)
