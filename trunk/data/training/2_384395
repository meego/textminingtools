If you are already used to Redhat, but don't want to fork out a lot of money for an enterprise class distro, then try <a href="http://www.centos.org" target="_blank">CentOS</a>.debian, <br />
easy to set up, loads of features. sleek and not bloated. <br />
i am running two debian servers at work, and one at home.<br />
my personal favorite.<br />
<br />
on the desktop, i like Arch and Ubuntu, - just evidence that i am a distro junkie.I am currently running redhat 9.0 for a friends small business (10 employees).  Looking to upgrade (or build new) to a new server class distribution.currently I am running sendmail, and apache (both are under utilized )  any recommendations appreciated
