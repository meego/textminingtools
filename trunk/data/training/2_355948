1. The latest firefox is 1.0.6, is this what you meant by firefox 6?<br />
Both Firefox and Thunderbird are available on the CD's in Yast (or via FTP/HTTP if you dont have the CD's), simply use the &quot;Install and Remove Software&quot; option and look for Mozilla-Firefox and Mozilla-Thunderbird, you should then have icons for both in the normal menus.<br />

2. Havent come across this before so I cant really help on this. Do any other programs show the same problem?I have loaded Suse 9.3 into my computer. I have 3 problems at this time that I need help with, Probaly alot more later. <br />
1. I have downloaded FireFox 6 and Thunderbird mail from the internet. It took me forever to find the right icon for FireFox installer to open the program into my computer, I still haven't found how to open thunderbird. The downloaded files are sitting in my Home Folder. There has to be a better way to download and open programs in Linux, I have had the same problem in all the linux programs I have tried.<br />
 <br />
2. When I have firefox running in Google or Dogpile, when I scroll up or down the font's are distorted and there are horizontal lines through the text. also when I scroll from let to right, there is verticle lines through the text. I can re-load the page and they disappear, until I use the scroll option and they are back. I hope you can help me with this.<br />

3.I am a novice to suse and to linux as a whole. I appreciate your help. Thanks Ron
