I would instead suggest contributing code to bluefish. They've already got a very nice editor to start with.<a href="http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/Linux_software_equivalent_to_Windows_software" target="_blank">http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/...ndows_software</a>Hi,<br />
I am looking for a tool like &quot;dreamweaver&quot;.<br />

Last time i tried it (1 year ago) was quite nice but left it when reading the generated code. If you're coming from dreamwaver, you won't be scared <img src="http://linuxquestions.cachefly.net/images/questions/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Smilie" class="inlineimg" /><br />
