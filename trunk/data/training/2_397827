hi<br />
At first i must say that i have rather slow machine so i'm searching apps which are don't need fast processor etc.<br />
I want to install SimpleKDE and I don't know how. I get three files which is:<br />
1. simplekde-arts-1.4.1.tar.gz<br />
2. simplekdebase-3.4.1.tar.gz<br />
3. simplekdelibs-3.4.1.tar.gz<br />
Which I should install first.<br />
<br />
Thank You for any idea.I believe that the install order for Simple is the same as for main KDE: arts, libs and then base.  And then everything else.
