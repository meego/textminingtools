Finally got it. It needed the gtk+1.2 devel package.Umm.. Probably Gtk2...  it doesn't hurt to have both Gtk and Gtk2 installed though for full compatibility.  What's the exact error message your recieving?<br />

The FTP on that site is down, but I was able to get GTK+2.0 through urpmi and I'm still getting the same error.<br />

EDIT:<br />
I have now also tried GTK+1.2 and gotten the same result.
