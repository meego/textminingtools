Hi<br />
<br />
I'm in the process of sharing my Sunbird calender using webdav, but I'm having trouble.<br />
<br />
Where does one enter the username and password for the file? When I &quot;publish entire calendar&quot; for example, I get:<br />
<br />
&quot;status code 405: Method not allowed&quot;<br />
<br />
I have been unable to input a username and password, as there seems to be no place to do this.<br />
<br />
Can someone please point me in the right direction?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

It asks for password when you publish file, just like when you acess restricted area in webpage.<br />
