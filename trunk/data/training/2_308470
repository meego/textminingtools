Valerie.GThumb has some basic photo album functions.Slightly different - I've found digikam very useful, especially if the imaging plugins are installed - lots of useful features such as batch conversion, printing multiple images, mpeg conversion, etc..Continuing in the direction of web-based albums, I use Gallery on my site(s)...<br />

Here is an example of a default install of the current Gallery release. No special customization whatsoever...<br />

di11rod<a href="http://linpha.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">LinPHA</a> is decent. It's web-based though, which would require Apache+PHP along with a few graphic libs. There are a boatload of similair ones out there, some free some not.How about <a href="http://MarginalHacks.com/Hacks/album/" target="_blank">album</a> from <a href="http://MarginalHacks.com/" target="_blank">MarginalHacks</a>?<br />
<br />
It's themeable, easy to use (no CGI or GUI), easy to install, extensible, etc, etc...Hi guys,<br />
<br />
Just wondering whether anybody knows of any photo album applications for our favourite OS.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be gratefully received.<br />
<br />
Many thanks,<br />
