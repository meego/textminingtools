33 years in the classroom taught me there are just some that have to learn the hard way. You can lead them to the answers but not force them to use them.<br />

Experience is a harsh teacher. First, she gives the test then the lesson. The lesson once learned changes the man forever. Paraphrase of Randy Alcorn in Safely HomeWell, my laptop has been dropped alot... SO I can imagine why the hard drive is a little crappy at the moment. I am running fedora core 4 on my laptop and the grub bootloader has died and I dont know the command to fix it.<br />
Its wont load grub, so it brings me to a grub command screen and I have no clue what to do o.o Help would be great <img src="http://linuxquestions.cachefly.net/images/questions/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Smilie" class="inlineimg" /><br />
