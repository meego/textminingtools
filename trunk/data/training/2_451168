Tinkthanks for your reply.<br />

i dont need a oss software which can be used for trading.<br />
i just want a software which can get some info from the stock exchange or some other source like yahoo finance.I'd suggest to ask the guys from the stock exchange exactly that since<br />
it's them you'll be trying to interface with.  To the best of my knowledge<br />
all the exchanges use a) either their own standard, or b) solutions like<br />
Reuters or Bloomberg, neither of which have an OSS interface to the best<br />
of my knowledge (again) (they didn't while I was working at an exchange some<br />
years ago).<br />
