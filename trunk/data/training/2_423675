I've never tried any, but heard anecdotal evidence that <b>less</b> works.  Someone also mentioned a program called <b>reed</b>...<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">

This is very discouraging, as I have now wasted my money on ebooks that should work in adobe reader but wont.  I think this functionality is very important, and NEEDS to be implemented.  I'm not sure what adobe is thinking, but it seems pointless if the important features of reader aren't even implemented in the linux version.</div>

Does it mention needing windows on the website? If the only requirement listed is adobe reader &gt; 6.0, and it turns out that you need more than just that they you can claim false advertising and demand a refund as the product is unsuitable for its intended purpose.<br />

This is UK law, I'm afraid I know nothing about elsewhere but I would assume consumers in the US are similarly protected.No luck..and I can't find the program reed.<br />

Thanks though.  I have emailed the ebook company.Hi everyone.  I bought an ebook, assuming it would be a pdf.  It downloaded a file called ebx.etd, which by googeling, seems common.  How do I use this?  I heard that it downloads the pdf through adobe reader?  I have reader installed but no luck. <br />
