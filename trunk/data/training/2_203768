Never tried FC1, but, have you tried using yum to install that package?I've never used yum before, and I can't say that I'm familiar with ldconfig. I just took the easy way out and compiled it from scratch. That worked.Have you tried running ldconfig?Anyone?I normally run Gentoo. Today, I'm running Fedora Core 1. I just swapped a few hard drives between computers, and was left without an operating system on my workstation. I needed to use Scribus to make a few flyers by the end of this weekend, so Fedora was the logical choice for a temporary operating system.<br />

When I try to install the Scribus 1.1.7 i686 RPM for Fedora, I get an error telling me that I need liblcms.so.1. I did a little searching and found LittleCMS 1.10-0.9.0 for an i686 Fedora system. The install of LittleCMS finishes without an error, but when I try to install Scribus, I still get the error about lacking lblcms. The liblcms.so.1 library is, however, in /usr/lib, but the Scribus RPM instal still fails. I've also tried installing Scribus 1.1.5, which I ran with Gentoo, but I get the same error. I've also tried rpm -Uvh'ing them at the same time, but it still doesn't work.
