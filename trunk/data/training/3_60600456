It's Kingston memory, 2x1G.  I don't know whether the system requires 
<br />
both chips to operate, but when I bought the machine they were first 
<br />
talking about 2x512K, and when I suggested that 2G would be more

appropriate, they went to 2x1G.  1x1G was never discussed.
<br />

<br />
I'll have to look for and *find* the motherboard manual to find out 
<br />
just what configurations it accepts, and what switches or BIOS 
<br />
paraneters I'll have to set.
<br />

<br />
Things would be so much easier if the store I bought it at hadn't gone 
<br />
out of business last February, &quot;unable to compete with the big box

Since you installed the package, the only thing that is left to do is to 
<br />
edit /boot/grub/menu.lst, in a very simple and intuitive way:
<br />

<br />
search for &quot;memtest86+&quot; inside this file, you should find something like:
<br />

<br />
## should update-grub create memtest86 boot option
<br />
## e.g. memtest86=true
<br />
##      memtest86=false
<br />
# memtest86=true
<br />

<br />
make sure its &quot;true&quot; and that it remains commented.
<br />

<br />
This will instruct update-grub (which you should run as the next step) to 
<br />
include memtest86 in the grub loader.
<br />

<br />
If everything goes well, you should see the output of the update-grub command 
<br />
similar to:
<br />

<br />
Searching for GRUB installation directory ... found: /boot/grub
<br />
Testing for an existing GRUB menu.list file ... found: /boot/grub/menu.lst

I've invoked many times memtest86 from Grub without any problem.

But since you're having so many problems, so often, you don't really need such

a time-consuming tool (I think). Just run your PC with one memory module 
<br />
installed at a time and see if you get correct behavior or not. Its faster, 
<br />
given the frequency of crashes you reported. Try firefox for example since it 
<br />
is causing u so many problems. Chances are that one memory module will show 
<br />
the signs immediately (in my case, there was a faulty mem module and when I 
<br />
used it alone, PC wouldn't even boot correctly, so it was piece of cake)
<br />

<br />
BTW, what memory do you have? is there any chance that you're giving it the 
<br />
wrong voltage from the respective BIOS settings?

Can openGL work with nv?  Do I have to carefully uninstall 
<br />
OpenGL-related packages that just know how to talk with nvidia?

You can run opengl with mesa libraries, which do opengl in software.
<br />
There is no modern card that has free drivers for opengl in hardware.
<br />
Only a few older cards have such drivers.
<br />

<br />
If you want hardware opengl you are stuck with the nvidia driver, but
<br />
for just running X in 2D, the nv driver generally works great.  For
<br />
testing a problem, it is often handy to elliminate what you can't get
<br />
source code for, such as the nvidia driver.

If you search recent posts on the list, you'll see that I also had problems 
<br />
with my memory and they were not discovered by memtest. So, as others have 
<br />
suggested too, maybe its better to open your box, remove memories and try 
<br />
them one by one for some time. If the problem persists with every single 
<br />
memory module, then either your memories are OK, or all of them are bad (but 
<br />
the latter, being such an extreme case, would have been probably detected by 
<br />
memtest...)
<br />

<br />
What is ur memory configuration by the way? I remember you said 2G, but is it 
<br />
2x1G, 4x512M, something else? and what about the manufacturer?

It's been a while now, about five months and I still haven't gor my 
<br />
AMD64 working properly.  Granted, I haven't been working at it *all* the 
<br />
time, have taken time off to bury my father and deal with an estate and 
<br />
taxes.  There are always death and taxes, aren't there?  It's working 
<br />
better than it was originally, but it still crashes.  At least, it gives 
<br />
the appearance of crashing.  The mouse freeses, and nothing seems to 
<br />
work properly except for the reset button.
<br />

<br />
Close investigation indicates this is not quite completely dead.  At least 
<br />
sometimes, the keyboard is still active for things like using tab to 
<br />
switch between fields in Firefox.  But control-alt-F* doesn't let me 
<br />
switch virtual terminals any more.  There's little I can do but press 
<br />
reset.  Control-alt-backspace shuts my X session down, but doesn't get 
<br />
me to anyplace I can recover from.
<br />

<br />
But another thing still works, too.  This morning I discovered that if I 
<br />
already have an ssh connexion into the machine from elsewhere, I can 
<br />
continue using it.  Except that response time has ballooned -- sometimes 
<br />
it responds in about ten or fifteen seconds, but usually it's minutes.  
<br />
Eventually, though, it does respond, so it's not dead.  I'll call this 
<br />
behaviour a &quot;crash&quot; in the rest of this message, though, as the machine 
<br />
is pretty well useless until a reboot.
<br />

<br />
Evidently, something is hogging some critical resource, possibly the CPU 
<br />
(the usual suspect) but it could also be a networking resource, since 
<br />
that's what the mouse and ssh seem to have in common.  Any other 
<br />
candidates?
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
But a lot of the system *does* run well.
<br />

<br />
When used as a file server, it works flawlessly.
<br />

<br />
When logged into remotely from another machine using XDMCP, it works 
<br />
flawlessly.
<br />

<br />
When used locally in text mode, it workd flawlessly.
<br />

<br />
When logged in locally using the X server it crashes.  I suspect a 
<br />
measure of software involvement in the crashes, because when I upgraded 
<br />
the nvidia drivers from 1.0.8756-1 to 1.0.8762-2 and also upgraded the 
<br />
kernel from 2.6.12 to 2.6.15  the crashes became less frequent.  Before, 
<br />
it seemed that it crashed when the mouse moved during screen updates.  
<br />
Not is seems (mostly) just to crash during menu operations.  Once it 
<br />
even crashed in gdm when I was using the menu to select my session.  It 
<br />
seems to crash less with fvwm than icewm.

The motherboard is an Asus A8N-VM-UAYGZ
<br />

<br />
described on the box as 
<br />
Aocket 939, nVidia
<br />
GeForce6100+nForce410,2000MT/sDual-
<br />
channel DDR,VGA integrated, PCI Express
<br />
X16 6-channel HD audio, 10/100 LAN,
<br />
ATA133*2+SATA II*28 USB 2.0,
<br />
Q-Fan technology, CrashFree BIOS
<br />

<br />
I have 2 G RAM, and 1G swap.
<br />

<br />
It's normally boots a 2.6.15 stock Debian kernel, runs etch, has nvidia 
<br />
drivers I compiled from the Debian nvidia-kernel-source package.
<br />

<br />
It can also boot a 2.6.12 kernel, which I keep around to have an 
<br />
alternative in case things go really wrong.  For this reason udev is 
<br />
held at 0.091-2, since the latest etch udev, 0.093-1, rejects the 2.6.12 
<br />
kernel.
<br />

<br />
There is no Microsoft software on this machine.  Not even close.  Not 
<br />
even wine.

<br />

<br />
What works:
<br />

<br />
text consoles, xterms.  I can compile, run, edit, use emacs, ssh to 
<br />
another machine to read my mail, edit quotas, run aptitude, etc.  All 
<br />
with no trouble.
<br />

<br />
What crashes:
<br />

<br />
* menus, sometimes, but enough to make me leery of opening menus.
<br />
* xjig, after a few puzzles, but rarely. ABout 5 to 10% chance of 
<br />
crashing per puzzle.  It used to be about 20% with the old nvidia 
<br />
drivers and 2.6.12.
<br />

<br />
What crashes fast:
<br />

<br />
* Firefox, especially when scrolling on complex web pages.
<br />
* Pan
<br />

<br />
Other browsers, but I forget which ones.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
What should I do to try and diagnose the problem?
<br />

<br />
* If I get into the system using a text login after a crash but before a 
<br />
reboot, what information should I collect?  From where in the system?
<br />
* What logs should I still bother collecting *after a reboot*, in case I 
<br />
can't do it before ther raboot?
<br />
* What software is available to test this hardware?
<br />

<br />
* Would it be diagnostic to do a fresh install of the 32-bit etch in new 
<br />
partition?  If so, which installer is actually likely to work these 
<br />
days?  (I've been seeing some worrisome reports on debian-user.  The 
<br />
installer I use *has* to be able to handle software RAID and lvm, since 
<br />
/home is on a reiser LVM sotware-RAID partition.  Is there any 
<br />
particular problem in kaving two boot partitions and having to keep LVM 
<br />
configuration files synchronised?

Well, memtest alias memtester, when asked to test all, allocated 3G of 
<br />
memory -- I only have 2G on my machine, and then failed to lock all of 
<br />
them into physical RAM -- small wonder.  Then it got killed.  Does it

have no mechanism for distinguishing whether it's testing RAM or swap

space?

That's the memtest now packaged in package memtester, formerly 
<br />
part of sysutils, which tests memory while Linux is running?
<br />
Or should I look at memtest86+?  Will it run on AMD64?
