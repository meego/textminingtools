The X11 driver is missing.  Check your build!I am using UBUNTU linux and i installed WINE. The installation is good...i followed everything that was said in the WINE website on how to install WINE. but when i try to run WINE it says that it can not create a window because X11 driver is missing. I tried to find X11 in the UBUNTU packages if it is there and i install every packe with X11 on it, then i compile and install WINE again but still it is still looking for X11.Pls help!!!!!Can you paste the exact error pls.Thanks for the help! i cant find the driver so i just uninstall wine and install it again now it works. thanks for the help!<br />
