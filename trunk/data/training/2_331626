give a more detailed/appropriate thread title.. give more (or at least any) detail to the problem at hand.. tell us what you have done and where the problem occurs, even posting output or logs would help.<br />
ok so.. you want to install filemaker? did you download the appropriate release for your linux distribution? did you read the instructions/readme that came with it or that was posted on the site you downloaded it from? whats the problem!?
