Hello, I am VERY new to linux, and I recently loaded knoppix onto my computer.<br />
<br />
I have been trying to connect to the internet via my wireless network, but I cant understand the Kwifi manager, the entire thing is in german.<br />
<br />
Is there a setting that I can change that would put the manager in english?<br />
<br />
Please help, I have only had Knoppix for 4 days now.im not sure, my friend set it up for me, hes a programmer...In the knoppix bootup sequence it offers you a chance to set a language. Did you set english or ignore it?
