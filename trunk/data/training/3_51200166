<br />
<pre style="margin: 0em;">After the board suggestion now the special one:
<br />
I need 4 Firewire 800 cards on ONE PC.<br>
<br />
<tt>Because of this special situation, I thought about 2 PCIe and two PCI-X 
<br />
firewire 800 cards.<br>
<br />
Has anyone a suggestion which card works under amd64 flawless at full speed?</tt><br>

How many ports do you need though?  Most cards have multiple ports and
<br />
the port count varies with the card model.

I have only used onboard firewire 400 personally, which seems to work

just fine.
