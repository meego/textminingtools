Hey ,<br />
<br />
My VoIP provider provides this neat little program that allows people to listen to their voicemail on their computer, trouble is it only runs in a Win32 environment from certain versions of Internet Explorer.<br />
<br />
There is an executable that runs and takes a single parameter. I think that this parameter contains the location of the voicemail file on their server. The following is an example of one of the codes:<br />

<br />
I know that it contains one of the following two strings:<br />
vml-01.tor.primus.ca or mytbb.primus.ca.<br />
<br />
I am clueless how I might go about decoding this string, if anyone has any thoughts as to were to begin?<br />
<br />
I thought first of decompiling the program, I thought it was written in C# but the C# compiler I used didn't seem to agree with me.<br />
<br />
I know when people do illegal activities and make key gens and stuff, they usually disassemble the application. Could this help?<br />
<br />
In terms of legalities, I read the the end user agreement from my telephone company and it has nothing written about decompiling this application. And the application has no license agreement.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

DavidWell, I wrote to the software programmer's of this particular program and they told me the above was encoded using Base64. So I made a PHP script to decode it and it still doesn't make a lot of sense...
