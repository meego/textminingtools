iam not sure if gnome supports that feature anymore. iam aware that it had that feature before but  iam not sure if its still supported. i wouldnt be surprised if they decided to remove it.<a href="http://manny.cluecoder.org/packages/nautilus-open-terminal/" target="_blank">http://manny.cluecoder.org/packages/...open-terminal/</a>sorry i dont remember it now. i was not much into linux then.Hello, I wish to edit my gnome right-click. I have gnome 2.12 on ubuntu breezy.<br />
<br />
I would like to be able to launch a terminal using the right click like we could in earlier gnome. What is the way to do it? I couldn't find any documentation about this, but, I may be looking at the wrong places, so kindly share with me and tricks, links, guides, howtos, etc. <img src="http://linuxquestions.cachefly.net/images/questions/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Smilie" class="inlineimg" /><br />

Cheers!Thanks for the link jong357, but this is not what I am looking for. I am looking for a way to customize the right-click.<br />
<br />
When I say customize, I mean adding entries to the right-click. <br />
<br />
Cheers!after reading wat u meant by customize,  i have to take back my words. when i said that it was possible in the earlier version of gnome, i was referring the fact that right click cud launch any application of choice. there was no feature for adding entries into the right click menu. <br />
<br />
i hope u come up with a sol. and post it here.how did one do it previously? If you remember, please let me know.
