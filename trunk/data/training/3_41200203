Hi,
<br />

<br />
we run a dual opteron 246 system with pure64 here for
<br />
80 days now. the server only runs mysql 4.1. i always
<br />
use the latest official mysql 4.1 binary
<br />
&quot;mysql-standard-4.1.7-unknown-linux-x86_64-glibc23.tar.gz&quot;
<br />

<br />
after changing pure64 to gcc-3.4 in apt/sources.list
<br />
and dist-upgrade, mysql always hang. tables got locked
<br />
but not unloked, so all queries blocked. also trying
<br />
to killall mysqld wasn't able - it just killed nothing
<br />
and the server kept running.
<br />

<br />
does anybody know why this happens? did i miss anything
<br />
important to upgrade? (i read something about apt-get
<br />
--reinstall - how to to this with all packages? it always
<br />
wants a list of packages...)
<br />

<br />
we reinstalled the whole system using pure64 and it works
<br />
again, so it must be something related to gcc-3.4.
<br />

<br />
it would be great it someone could tell me how to upgrade
<br />
to gcc-3.4 from pure64 so everything just works fine but
<br />
a with a little more performance :)
<br />

<br />
thanks a lot,
<br />
corin

Why don't you use the mysql package from the gcc-3.4 archive? 
<br />
I got some reports which indicated that this works fine.

You need to 'apt-get install --reinstall' all packages which use the 
<br />
'libstdc++5' when you upgrade from pure64 to the gcc-3.4 archive.

An easy way to achieve this would be something like this:
<br />

<br />
dpkg --get-selections | grep -w install | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -m 10 
<br />
-- apt-get -y --reinstall install
<br />
