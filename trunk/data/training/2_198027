Can you give more details about the kernel. Is your kernel the original fedora kernel or a custom kernel. Fedora uses ext2/ext3 so you will need that compiled into the kernel to be able to access your fedora partitions.ok i have a 2.6.6 kernal and its all configured but when i set up GRUB to boot it, the kernal always has a error and will not boot.  it says something about ext2 having errors loading but i dont use ext2 or evan have it compiled in the kernal.  so wtf.  i drew the conclusion that fedora is bad.  i want to use gentoo but i have to much stuff to recompile and its to much effort.  but i would like to upgrade to kernal 2.6.6 so if anyone says it can be done on FC1 then maybe i will give it another chance.
