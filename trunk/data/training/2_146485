I just installed the firefox package for linuxpackages.net and I have no back or forward buttons?<br />
 <br />
I was wondering if anyone has this same issue.<br />
<br />
The &quot;firebird&quot; version work fine. I'm running into issues with ver. 0.8.<br />
<br />
Also for some reason it will not remember my window placement every time I start it up, it starts up half off my screen, kinda bothers me.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatI didn't have those buttons either until I put my theme to default...<br />
I too have problems with it crashing... I'm seriously considering going back to .7were would one find that ? I installed the one from mozilla's site with the same issues.I just installed mine two days ago and it was doing the same thing. I finally uninstalled it because it was crashing every hour,on the hour. If you find the problem please post it.Just install from the unix .tgz.  Ditch the custom Slack package.yep, my theme caused it.  Hope we can theme it soon <img src="http://linuxquestions.cachefly.net/images/questions/images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Frown" class="inlineimg" /><br />
