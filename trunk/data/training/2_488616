Once that's working, run gmplayer and right-click on it somewhere, go to preferences and set up audio and video. Can use OpenGL on most systems if video drivers are installed correctly...  click on a dvd.<br />

You may need some dvd libraries. On fedora they are:<br />
<br />
$ rpm -qa | grep livdvd<br />
libdvdnav-0.1.10-3.fc5<br />
libdvdcss-1.2.9-3.fc5.at<br />
libdvdnav-0.1.10-3.fc5<br />
libdvdread-0.9.6-3.fc5.at<br />
libdvdread-0.9.6-3.fc5.at<br />
<br />
This is how I set up my DVD to play automatically upon insert using xine. Can be adapted to use Mplayer.<br />
