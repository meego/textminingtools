Hello,
<br />

<br />
This is the error message I get when I start k3b.
<br />

<br />
Unable to find cdrecord executable
<br />
K3b uses cdrecord to actually write CDs.
<br />
Solution: Install the cdrtools package which contains cdrecord.
<br />

<br />
Well:
<br />
fzr:~# apt-get install cdrecord
<br />
Reading Package Lists... Done
<br />
Building Dependency Tree... Done
<br />
cdrecord is already the newest version.
<br />
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
<br />

<br />
Any suggestions?
<br />

<br />

using k3bsetup (you need root access) you can tell k3b where to look
