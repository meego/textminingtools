You could mount the DVD ISO with the loopback device and copy the packages to different disc directories while keeping all the installation files for the first disc.  Then create bootable ISOs of each of those directories.  You could also just download the CD ISOs...I have downloaded DVD image of Debian 3.1 (Sarge). But I don't have DVD burner. Can I convert this DVD image to several CD-ROM images, so that I can burn those onto CD-R using my CD-recorder? <br />
Thanks,<br />
