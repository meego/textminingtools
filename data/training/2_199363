There's also Kenlive (for KDE), or another one I can't remember the name of -- try to search sourceforge for video editing and see what you come up with.hey guys.<br />

im just wondering what a good video editing program is for linux.  ive got a sony hc-20 handycam w/ both firewire and usb hook-ups to my notebook.  i film me and my friends skatebaoradiong, so i need a good video editing program that will let me put music into it easyily, edit (shorten, cut, speed-up etc..) and possibliy some good effects.<br />
<br />
im also running on a G4 (PPC) and not sure if that will make a big difference or not.Kino, Broadcast 2000, Cinelerra, Qdvdauthor, etc.  Lots of stuff.. Also mainactor, and softimage if you wanna burn some money.
