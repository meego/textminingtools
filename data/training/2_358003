I think that you are going to need to do all that stuff yourself, what is the reason for not doing it?hi everyone,<br />
          i want to install j2sdk1.4.2 on my linux machine<br />
          but without interaction i.e. automatically it should accept the agreement, and choose a location and execute './filname.bin' command and install j2sdk1.4.2<br />
       how shall i go about it<br />
<br />
    waiting eagerly for the reply<br />
     thanks in advance
