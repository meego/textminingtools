Hi!<br />
<br />
My XChat does not reply on any other CTCP query other than VERSION.<br />
I've set up the apropriate commands in Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; CTCP Replies, <br />
but it just doesn't obey what i've put there.<br />
even some simplistig thing like:<br />
TIME --&gt; echo HELLO<br />
does not work.<br />
<br />
the nctcp command works fine from input box though,<br />
/nctcp Nick BLAH answer<br />
works fine.<br />
<br />
The whole CTCP section seems not to be used, but i'd like to turn it on.<br />
<br />
How can i do this?<br />
<br />
thanks in advance, polemonXChat DOES react on CTCP messages, but it shows a very weird behaviour.<br />
some CTCP querrys require an additional parameter, but most don't. However, to make the reaction command being executed, a parameter MUST be supplied!<br />
Example:<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px">Code:</div>
	<pre class="bbcodeblock" style="margin:0px; padding:3px; border:1px inset; width:98%; height:34px; overflow:auto"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">/ctcp mynick TIME</div></pre>
</div>
Does nothing,<br />
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px">Code:</div>
	<pre class="bbcodeblock" style="margin:0px; padding:3px; border:1px inset; width:98%; height:34px; overflow:auto"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">/ctcp mynick TIME a</div></pre>
</div>
Triggers XChat to execute the command.<br />
Instead of 'a' you can type any character, doesn't matter if it's a number or whatever.<br />
<br />
Usually you don't supply a parameter (PING is an excepttion), so the reaction is not performed.<br />
<br />
My question is now: Hot to make those responses work without the parameter?
