What kind of script perl, PHP ?Hi, <br />

When I create a file on a server through the web, the owner is nobody and the group is nobody ... because this is the user/group that apache runs in ... how do I configure apache so that whenever a user runs a script in his/her directory, the files created by apache/php are owned by that user instead of apache?<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:2px">Quote:</div>
	<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">
	<tr>
		<td class="bbcodeblock" style="border:1px inset">

Yes. PHP.<br />

Is the process different if using perl? If it is, I'd also like to know.
