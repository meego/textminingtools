&gt; &gt; vcommand on grub or lilo. Now I read about adding &quot;noapictimer&quot; should
<br />
&gt; &gt; solve this, too. My question aimed to an technical answer, if the
<br />
&gt; &gt; commands &quot;disable_timer_pin_1&quot; and &quot;noapictimer&quot; are doing the same, or
<br />
&gt; &gt; if they both solve the mentioned problem in different ways.
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt; I believe the problem occoured with ATI chipsets on laptops.  As far as
<br />
&gt; I have understood it, the problem is that the timer interrupts occour
<br />
&gt; both on the 8259 interrupt controller, and through the apic.  I believe
<br />
&gt; 'disable_timer_pin_1' makes the kernel ignore the 8259 interrupt for the
<br />
&gt; timer, and that 'noapictimer' ignores the apic interrupt for the timer.
<br />
&gt; Since the problem seems to be getting two interrupts for every timer
<br />
&gt; event, one for each interrupt method, it makes sense that disabling
<br />
&gt; either one will solve the problem.  It doesn't matter which one you
<br />
&gt; disable as long as you disable one of the two.
<br />
&gt;
<br />
&gt; It really looks like a bug in the design of the chipset, although it may
<br />
&gt; just be that the BIOS/ACPI tables are done wrong, which is rather common
<br />
&gt; it seems.  Too often the ACPI tables for windows work, but are
<br />
&gt; incomplete or wrong for other operating systems.  Apparently on such
<br />
&gt; systems, telling linux to lie to acpi and pretend to be windows xp often
<br />
&gt; solves such strange problems.

Hi Len !
<br />

<br />
It seems, that in last kernel 2.6.17 this problem is solved. I read the 
<br />
documentation of the kernel, and (as you wrote), these timers just misbehave 
<br />
if you have a chipset of ATI. This is the case on my notebook: ATI chipset !
<br />

<br />
Well, without this kernel-command it is running fine with the newest kernel. 
<br />
So there are no problems any more. I additionally did hope, that this could 
<br />
be the reason, why my 3D-accelertion with the &quot;fglrx&quot;-river is still slow. 
<br />
All 3D-functions are o.k., I get the box with the rotating wheels when 
<br />
starting &quot;fgl_glxgears&quot;, but they are rather slow. About 50 FPS, that is 
<br />
speed as mesa-glx shows ! Should be 600 FPS, that would be o.k. &quot;fglrxinfo&quot; 
<br />
shows the correct driver-version, and &quot;glxinfo |grep direct&quot; shows  &quot;direct 
<br />
rendering: Yes&quot;
<br />

<br />
So verything seems t be o.k. with the software, and my idea was, something 
<br />
else, but not the driver is braking my system.
<br />

<br />
You can believe me: I checked really everything, and do not know, where to 
<br />
look now. 
<br />

<br />
Additonally I tested every xorg.conf I found in the web and checked a whole 
<br />
bunch of settings. Sadly no success ! ATI really sux ! (This notebook I got 
<br />
as new of a guarantee as exchanged, I had Nvidia-card on the other noteook).
<br />

<br />
And I have never heard of someone who got 3d-acceleration really fast running 
<br />
with a pure 64-bit-system with ATI......
<br />

<br />
Thats a little bit information about the background, maybe other people this 
<br />
could help, too
<br />

<br />
Thanks for all your help !

Why not use Chrony and your local pool.ntp.org servers for time? 
<br />
Also what happens if you don't reboot for a long time, then how do

you keep your time correct?

Not that it makes a difference, but those are kernel commands, I 
<br />
believe all grub does is pass those on to the kernel anyway.

I had (as many others) the same problem with my HP laptop based on the

ATI Xpress200M chipset. So, at the time of 2.6.15, I had to add

<br />
&gt; 
<br />
&gt; Based on that, I'd say that 'noapictimer' just doesn't use that timer,
<br />
&gt; while disable_timer_pin_1 provides a workaround for the problem. I guess
<br />
&gt; I'd use the latter if it works.
<br />

<br />
Sounds reasonable to me.

&gt; First of all, which kernel version are you using??
<br />
&gt; I had (as many others) the same problem with my HP laptop based on the
<br />
&gt; ATI Xpress200M chipset. So, at the time of 2.6.15, I had to add
<br />
&gt; &quot;disable_timer_pin_1&quot; to the grub parameters not to have a double timing
<br />
&gt; of almost everything (but you already knew that).
<br />
&gt; Now, starting with ker 2.6.16, the bug about wrong timing has been
<br />
&gt; corrected directly in the kernel, so using this kernel version or above
<br />
&gt; you won't need the explicit definition of that param anymore.
<br />
Hey, this is a new information ! Cool ! My adding was of the tim eof 2.6.15 
<br />
indeed.  I did not know, that this is fixed now. I am running kernel 2.6.17 
<br />
on my notebook Acer Aspire 5020
<br />

<br />
&gt; Hope it could help.
<br />
&gt;
<br />

<br />
 Oh yes, it does ! Great ! Thanks !

&gt; if you have a chipset of ATI. This is the case on my notebook: ATI chipset !
<br />

<br />
Hey, since you're new to the solution of the double timing, probably you
<br />
don't even know anything about the more problematic ACPI bug with the
<br />
ATI Xpress 200M chipset.
<br />
If you want to preserve your Turion64, pay a visit to:

<br />

<br />
&gt; Well, without this kernel-command it is running fine with the newest kernel. 
<br />
&gt; So there are no problems any more. I additionally did hope, that this could 
<br />
&gt; be the reason, why my 3D-accelertion with the &quot;fglrx&quot;-river is still slow. 
<br />
&gt; All 3D-functions are o.k., I get the box with the rotating wheels when 
<br />
&gt; starting &quot;fgl_glxgears&quot;, but they are rather slow. About 50 FPS, that is 
<br />
&gt; speed as mesa-glx shows ! Should be 600 FPS, that would be o.k. &quot;fglrxinfo&quot; 
<br />
&gt; shows the correct driver-version, and &quot;glxinfo |grep direct&quot; shows  &quot;direct 
<br />
&gt; rendering: Yes&quot;
<br />
&gt; 
<br />
&gt; So verything seems t be o.k. with the software, and my idea was, something 
<br />
&gt; else, but not the driver is braking my system.
<br />
&gt; 
<br />
&gt; You can believe me: I checked really everything, and do not know, where to 
<br />
&gt; look now. 
<br />
&gt; 
<br />
&gt; Additonally I tested every xorg.conf I found in the web and checked a whole 
<br />
&gt; bunch of settings. Sadly no success ! ATI really sux ! (This notebook I got 
<br />
&gt; as new of a guarantee as exchanged, I had Nvidia-card on the other noteook).
<br />
&gt; 
<br />
&gt; And I have never heard of someone who got 3d-acceleration really fast running 
<br />
&gt; with a pure 64-bit-system with ATI......
<br />

<br />
Here fglrx 8.27.10 is working fine... about 480 fps, not 600 but that's
<br />
not bad.
<br />
Your situation sounds strange.
<br />

<br />
&gt; Thats a little bit information about the background, maybe other people this 
<br />
&gt; could help, too

<br />

<br />
I believe the problem occoured with ATI chipsets on laptops.  As far as
<br />
I have understood it, the problem is that the timer interrupts occour
<br />
both on the 8259 interrupt controller, and through the apic.  I believe
<br />
'disable_timer_pin_1' makes the kernel ignore the 8259 interrupt for the
<br />
timer, and that 'noapictimer' ignores the apic interrupt for the timer.
<br />
Since the problem seems to be getting two interrupts for every timer
<br />
event, one for each interrupt method, it makes sense that disabling
<br />
either one will solve the problem.  It doesn't matter which one you
<br />
disable as long as you disable one of the two.
<br />

<br />
It really looks like a bug in the design of the chipset, although it may
<br />
just be that the BIOS/ACPI tables are done wrong, which is rather common
<br />
it seems.  Too often the ACPI tables for windows work, but are
<br />
incomplete or wrong for other operating systems.  Apparently on such
<br />
systems, telling linux to lie to acpi and pretend to be windows xp often
<br />
solves such strange problems.
