It depends on the shell you are using. If it is csh it works, but, for example, you have to use export in case you use bash.<br />
type csh and the you´ll be able to use setenv.<br />

Bash and csh have two different syntax structures.  Both have similar functionality, but do things slightly differently.  For example:<br />
in csh: setenv VAR value<br />
in bash: export VAR=valueHow do you do a setenv in redhat 8.0 ? - setenv doesn't appear to be a command which can be called in the same way as on unix.<br />

Software I am trying to use has a script run from &lt;cshrc&gt; in the form 'alias source /home/x/bin/setupprog' (I am just trying to run it in bashrc) that sets global variables using setenv. Since setenv doesn't work in bash can I just put the line '#! /bin/csh' at the start of the script (which is then called as an alias) ?<br />
