&gt;&gt;Thanks Matt.  I have changed the driver to Vesa, and so far I can't make

&gt;&gt;it crash.  I am now upgrading from stable to unstable (amd64) and
<br />
&gt;&gt;downloading a current smp kernel.  If all stays stable (pun intended), then
<br />
&gt;&gt;I'll ask the experts for suggestions regarding graphics boards and drivers.

&gt; If the vesa driver works, the open source 'nv' driver, may also work.
<br />
&gt; Its nvidia specific, but not as good as the official binary nvidia
<br />
&gt; drivers. As far as I know, nv performs much better than vesa, but much
<br />
&gt; worse than nvidia.
<br />
&gt;
<br />
No, I started the whole process with the open source 'nv' driver.  I will
<br />
try it again after this upgrade completes, but 'nv' is what I was using for
<br />
several weeks before finally trying 'nvidia' which did not help, either.
<br />

Thanks again.

I've had a similar problem, but it went away when I installed Ubuntu.
<br />
Whatever they've done right, I hope it propagates to Debian soon.
<br />
By the way, I had the same problem whether in 32 and 64-bit more,
<br />
and whether I used the vesa, nv, or nvidia drivers.
<br />
&gt; 
<br />
&gt; Does Nvidia offer drivers for the NForce4 motherboard chipset, and if

&gt; so, does it make any difference?  I plan to upgrade my video board, but
