You'll need to download, make and install 'checkinstall' if you cannot find that package available as a Fedora package. I don't know anything about Fedora.. however packages are distributed. Otherwise, just download and make the checkinstall program.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/" target="_blank">http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/</a><br />
<br />
After you've installed 'checkinstall' go into the directory of that program that you've built that you wish to uninstall.<br />
<br />
checkinstall -R<br />
will build an rpm package, so if you run<br />
checkinstall -R make install<br />
<br />
Yes it will try to install that same program you want un-installed. After checkinstall is done, you will have an RPM of the installation. You should be able to remove it using rpm.<br />
<br />
checkinstall will build a few different packages, so you might want to check out the documentation before you use checkinstall. I actually highly recommend you read more about it from their website and docs rather than just by what I've described.<br />
<br />
Also, there may be uninstallation instructions somewhere with that program you want uninstalled, if you haven't already gone through them all.<br />
