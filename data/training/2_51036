Hello FORUM, I'm a Linux newbie, recently gifted with a copy of Mandrake Linux 8.2.  I'm thinking of installing it on my Micron Trek 2 Laptop, 366MHz processor, 256MHz ram, 20gh HD partitioned to 3 equal drives running winXP on drive C.<br />
I would appreciate any &amp; all advise on suitability/compatibility, warnings, pitfalls, stumbling blocks, avoidances, etc..<br />
I'm looking forward to joining the Linux Community, hoping to do it as seamlessly as possible!  Thanx EricCheck these...<br />
