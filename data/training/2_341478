I'm going to be getting a graphics card and was wondering if there was any relatively easy programs to render 3D with?  I just want something that's simple which I can just fool around with, nothing serious or professional quality, as I've never rendered anything in my life.  Just looking for a recommendation.Blender is the very best (free) program for Linux.  A little warning though: The interface is... well... different. It's either love or hate it. I found the shortcuts really nice, but without a hole bunch of books and online tutorials, you most likely will give up on Blender. I love Blender ^_^.I was looking to give 3d modelling a try myself, and I'm a bit of a newbie to the Linux platform.  Just wanted to say thanks, your post was helpful!  ;-)  I'm off to give Blender a try...blender, huh?  well so long as I can manage to render a cube i'll be happy =)Ah, rendering a cube is easy ^_^.<br />

Not that difficult, is it? =). I'm trying to find some tutorials for you about blender, but seems like their server is down. Give it a whirl later at <a href="http://www.blender3d.org" target="_blank">www.blender3d.org</a> and see how it goes =)<br />
<br />
Good luck!I followed this tut. to get myself familiar with Blender3D.<br />
