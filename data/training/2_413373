Hi!<br />
I've just mirrored an old server working with apache 1.3 to a new server working with apache2. Now I'm trying to take configuration elements from the old httpd.conf (apache 1.3) to put it in the httpd.conf of apache2. In apache1.3's http.conf there is a part called srm.conf. Can I just copy it in order to save time or should I copy each part (for example: Alias, Redirect, RedirectPermanent...) of it into the correct part of the new httpd.conf? <br />
<br />
Transfering the infos from the old to the new httpd.conf is quite complicated because I've to be careful not to forget anything. Is there any easy to do it (when someone make an upgrade from apache1 to 2 for example)?<br />
<br />
Thanks.When I reinstalled my system, I tried just copying the file directly into the new config file.  Apache refused to run for me.  I'm not saying that it won't work, it just didn't work for me.  If you figure it out, I would really like to know.<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">

sorry I had a lot of problems with apache and couldn't make it run (but for some other reasons).<br />

The include of srm.conf works. Here more explanations:<br />

				The AccessConfig and ResourceConfig directives no longer exist. Existing instances of these directives can be replaced with the Include  directive which has equivalent functionality. If you were making use of the default values of these directives without including them in the configuration files, you may need to add Include conf/access.conf and Include conf/srm.conf to your httpd.conf. In order to assure that Apache reads the configuration files in the same order as was implied by the older directives, the Include directives should be placed at the end of httpd.conf, with the one for srm.conf  preceding the one for access.conf.
