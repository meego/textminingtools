you need the real media player plugin for firefox - from the mozilla web page.I am using firefox. I was browsing snehatv.com, in that there were some .rm files i wanted to play. What happened was, the browser hs set totem player as default to play those files. If i want to set it to realplayer, what should i do?<br />
Its really irritating that Totem does not respond well.
