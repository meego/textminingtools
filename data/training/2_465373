Alternatively, you have lmcilwai<font color="Red">n</font> as the home directory name but you have lmcilwai as the user:group - is there a typo?<br />
<br />
Do any of those possibilities fit your setup?Your owner and group are correct, it is just truncating to keep the columns in ls -l neatly lined up.Hello all,<br />
<br />
I'm having an issue that I need to try and have fixed.  Fetchmail on my machine is complaining that it can't read my .procmailrc file in my home directory that is used for mail filtering.<br />
<br />
What I am getting in my fetchmail log is:<br />
procmail: Suspicious rcfile &quot;/home/lmcilwain/.procmailrc&quot;<br />
procmail: Couldn't read &quot;/home/lmcilwain/.procmailrc&quot;<br />
<br />
Nothing has changed with this file in months and all of a sudden it just stopped working.<br />
Here are the permissions on my .procmailrc file:<br />
<br />
-rw-r--r--    1 lmcilwai  lmcilwai      1484 18 Jul 23:34 .procmailrc<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me figure out what in the world is going on with this?Edit: Hopefully Matir's suggestions fixes the problem before you get to trying this...<br />

On my system, I can create a user:group of lmcilwain:lmcilwain and the ownership displays correctly (doesn't truncate the last 'n'). Are the other files in that directory owned the same way? If so, does running the following as root work?<br />

Many setups truncate usernames to 8 characters (the original UNIX max username length).  Others replace usernames &gt; 8 chars with the numeric UID.  I doubt it's mis-owned.Well it seems that the issue was that my user directory was set to world writeable.  I didn't put two and two together...<br />
<br />
I was working on trying to share a folder via smb on my system and I must have done something screwy.  I went back to what I was doing and noticed that mistake (wierd).  So I sent the permission as close to what I remember as possible and then checked my fetchmail and procmail logs and low and behold it is filtering again.<br />

I do however want to fix the way my UID and GID ownership is displaying but I'm tempted to leave it as is if its working for me...  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the help guys, I really appreciate it.No its not a typo that was what I cut and pasted right fromt he terminal.. My username is definitly not lmcilwai.<br />
<br />
But how can I fix this.  This user doesn't exist anywhere so I can't figure out a user ID that correspond to it to change the ownership.
