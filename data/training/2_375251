You can do it a few ways...<br />
<br />
1) Do it in windows, move it over.<br />
<br />
2) This is really tricky, took me awhle, and I wish I had done it another way... When you first click DL, it will display a meesage with a link, something about if you are having troubles click there. But it goes really fast, so you will have to use a few attempts to get it clicked, but if you click there, you can get a straight DL that works.<br />

3) Find the web location, which I don't have on me, and use wget or another transfer engine.Alright, I give up... how do I download the new ATI driver (8.18.6)? When I hit the &quot;agree&quot; button on the redirect page, it loads the driver in a new mozilla window - then I can't save it unless it's in html format (no binary). I've heard some people get it with wget, but how?<br />

Thanks in advance!
