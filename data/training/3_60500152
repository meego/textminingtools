<br />
&gt; It's not supported in kernel, but all the drivers are GPL, and in

&gt; Debian (see &quot;apt-cache search rt2500&quot; ) And it works GREAT!
<br />
&gt;
<br />

<br />
Note: For smp kernels (like Athlon64 X2 ), you have to get a current cvs 
<br />
snapshot, since the smp support was added to the rt2500 module less than a 
<br />
month ago. I guess the rt2500 package uses a released version, so it won't 
<br />
work (but I haven't tried lately, only months ago).

Hi Harald,

Atheros chipset works well for me. Non-free driver but native at least.
<br />
I didn't use it on amd64 though.

2.6.17-rc kernels have the bcm43xx reverse engineered driver merged. It
<br />
doesn't work perfect yet (no WPA for me, but some have it working), but
<br />
good enough to be useful. I use it with a Linksys cardbus WPC54G-v3 EU,
<br />
but it's supposed to work with the PCI version as well (I might want to
<br />
try that this weekend, have the card but not yet enough time to plug it
<br />
into the machine).
