I cannot reproduce this here with unstable (apache2-mpm-worker 
<br />
2.0.55-4.1).
<br />

Package: apache2-mpm-worker
<br />
Version: 2.0.55-4
<br />
 
<br />
Kernel version: Linux 2.6.12 #2 SMP i686 GNU/Linux
<br />

<br />
Steps to Reproduce:
<br />
1) Create a site config file test in /etc/apache2/sites-available by
<br />
using following command:
<br />
cd /etc/apache2/sites-available 
<br />
echo Listen 1234 &gt; test
<br />

<br />
2) Enable site test and reload
<br />
a2ensite test
<br />
/etc/init.d/apache2 reload
<br />

<br />
3) Disable site test and reload
<br />
a2dissite test
<br />
/etc/init.d/apache2 reload
<br />

<br />
After this reloading, apache will begin to use up all memory rapidly and
<br />
finally be killed by linux kernel.
<br />

<br />
It can use up 2G memory in just 5 seconds!
<br />

<br />
There is another server with the same apache2 version but using
<br />
apache2-mpm-prefork model doesn't have this problem.
<br />

<br />
This problem won't happen if I use &quot;/etc/init.d/apache2 restart&quot;.
<br />

<br />
I have reported this problem to apache2 but they can't reproduce this
<br />
problem on their system. 
<br />

<br />
Thanks.
