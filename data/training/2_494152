Hmm, that's interesting. I tried mplayer from the command line. The disk allegedly has 3 audio tracks followed by 1 video cd track. I can play the audio tracks with a cd player. When I try mplayer vcd://4 /dev/hdc it scans tracks 1,2 and 3 but can't find a 4th track. So I tried the disk in my standalone DVD player and that too can play 3 audio tracks but cannot find a 4th track. So, either Polydor are lying and there is no video track there or something strange is happening and the devices cannot see this track. <br />
<br />
AndyI cannot get xine to play VCD. I have FC5 with two CDRW/DVDR drives. I recently rebuilt after a my northbridge fried and i bought a new mobo. <br />
<br />
After installation, I ran yum update so the system is up to date. Then downloaded xine0.99.4 and xine-lib1.1.2 rpms and installed. This all worked except avi would not play so i downloaded the latest source and compiled and everything worked including avi, mpg, wmv and DVD (obvisouly i installed DVDCSS and w32 codecs). <br />
<br />
Then I found an old VCD disk and tried to play it but it won't. I am trying to play it in the same drive as I play DVDs in. I have checked the device settings in xine and the VCD device path is set to /dev/hdc but I have also tried creating a link /dev/vcd linked to /dev/hdc. Now, if I hit the VCD button on the xine control panel, nothing happens and the disk does not attemt to spin up. If I hit the VCDC button, the disk appears to spin up and xine crahses and exits. If I type xine vcd://4 (which is the correct track number) at a command line, xine starts and gives the error There is no input plugin available to handle 'vcd://4'. <br />
<br />
Any ideas please?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

AndyYes, my Sony DVP-NS305 that sites under my VCR and Sky box. It only finds 3 audio tracks and no video although this is a Polycor musci CD with the VCD logao all over the cover.<br />
