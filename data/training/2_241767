Ok, so, the dvd writer tell's me the +r's i burned contain the exact same files as the +rw. I don't understand why my dvd reader in my computer and my standalone player can see the +rw but not the +r.<br />

edit. Okay, but my playstation2 is able to play the +r's. I mean, wtf?ok, i fixed the speed issue. it was my hd, i have 2, one of em is slower than a snail (apparently). anyway, my standalone dvd player still won't read the +r's, while the rw's are fine.. any idea how this is possible??Could it be that the dvd+r's are sucky quality? I heard that low quality could lead to incompatibility... Has anyone else experienced this?Ok so, I used a dvd+r from a friend, he said it was good quality. Now the dvd+r works in my standalone dvd player (yes!), but still not in the dvd player in my computer....I mean, whoever invented these pieces of ****.<br />

edit. and why do the dumb rw's, different format or something?My dvd burner should be able to burn these dvd+r disc's at 8x. K3b reports it will burn at 8x, but it hasn't been above 4x and it fluctuates between 1x and 4x. Also the dvd+r's can't be read by anything other then my dvd writer. Note that dvd+rw's burn equally slow but can be read by anything.<br />
Anybody know what could be the problem? Any repsonse would be appreciated.
