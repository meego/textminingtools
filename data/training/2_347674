Yeah, tried that.  I even tried fooling around with KDE's window settings to try to make Konq remember stuff.<br />

Still not, spatial nautilus, but getting there.  Anybody know anymore tweaks I can do (besides getting Gnome :-P )How much of a spatial desktop can you get KDE to be?  (ie: Gnome and Mac style of doing things.  &quot;The window is the folder&quot; etc.)<br />

I've been reading some stuff recently and I think a spatial desktop is an interesting idea... not sure if I'd like it, but I'd be willing to try.  If I can try it without installing anymore software, that'd be great.  Also, it'd be nice to see how flexible KDE can get.I think in the KDE settings, you can configure Konqueror to open directories in a new window. Its not exactly like spatial nautilus, but its the closest thing I can think of.
