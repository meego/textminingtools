What kind of query is it doing? Can you post the ethereal output?I think this began happening after doing quite a bit of deleting off my Windows machine through a SMB share on the linux side. Now my linux box is CONSTANTLY accessing the network with a query path packet looking for /.Trash-*linuxusername* over and over and over again. Is there any way to remedy this? I can delete the .Trash-*username* from the windows share but then it constantly looks for it and just gets a path not found return packet. I am using ethereal to monitor this.
