Well I've figured most of it out in the meantime,<br />
<br />
I just had to add this to my ~/.asoundrc   config file:<br />
<br />
pcm.!default {<br />
    type route<br />
    slave.pcm surround51<br />
    slave.channels 6<br />
    ttable.0.0 1<br />
    ttable.1.1 1<br />
    ttable.0.2 1<br />
    ttable.1.3 1<br />
    ttable.0.4 0.5<br />
    ttable.1.4 0.5<br />
    ttable.0.5 0.5<br />
    ttable.1.5 0.5<br />
}<br />
<br />
I now get stereo sound playing on all the outputs.<br />
<br />
The only problem I have left is that volume control only adjusts the volume on the front left &amp; right speakers <img src="http://linuxquestions.cachefly.net/images/questions/images/smilies/confused.gif" border="0" alt="" title="Confused" class="inlineimg" /> <br />
<br />
Anyone have any ideas/suggestions how to fix this?<br />
<br />
ThanksHi,<br />
<br />
Is there anyway to &quot;split&quot; normal stereo output into more channels?<br />
<br />
I am using a C-Media CM8738 5.1 sound card, with the ALSA driver, under Fedora Core 2.<br />
There is no problems with the driver, Using Xine or MPlayer I can experience full 5.1 surround sound without any hastle.<br />
The thing is with normal system sound output like when I use Xmms, I only get stereo<br />
out the front left and right speakers, the rear and center speakers remain quiet, interestingly the sub-woofer does output.<br />
<br />
So my question: Can I configure ALSA to output to all channels by default?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
