That's konsole's shortcut - running from another terminal should fix it (like xterm), or the proper thing to do would be to go to &quot;Settings -&gt; Configure Shortcuts&quot;, find each shortcut in the list and set it to &quot;none&quot; instead of &quot;default&quot;.Thanks!!!The default behavior of KDE is evidently to capture certain keystrokes<br />
rather than pass those keystrokes on to whatever application is<br />
running.<br />
<br />
For example, in a konsole window I ssh to some machine, and<br />
then execute &quot;emacs -nw&quot;.  That's when the bad news begins.<br />
<br />
Emacs relies upon specific keystrokes for various commands<br />
and editing functions. However, rather than allowing those<br />
keystrokes to be passed through to emacs, the konsole<br />
captures the keystrokes -- for it's own purpose.<br />
<br />
A specific example is the sequence control-meta-s which instructs<br />
emacs to initiate a regular expression search. The konsole refuses<br />
to pass that on to emacs, and instead captures it and consequently<br />
brings up a &quot;Rename Session - Konsole&quot; dialog box.<br />
<br />
How do I turn off all these lame shortcuts so that applications in<br />
general ,and emacs in particular, are usable -- meaning they<br />
receive the keystrokes I type ??!!<br />

<br />
Not sure whether it's konsole or KDE, though, since<br />
I don't use that hog.<br />
