About dvd, try dvd::rip. Not exactly the same as dvd shrink, but will help.Greetings. I've set up SuSE 9.3 and I'm using KDE.  I've got two keyboard layouts, one greek and one french. In the greek layout, I've opted to include the latin layout (obviously). I've also opted to have a different layout for each application. My problem is that the default layout that comes up is the greek one (which seems reasonable), but I'd like it to be the english layout. Is there a way I can accomplish this?<br />

By the way, is there a program like DVD Shrink for linux? Thanks for your time.
