&quot;In the popular eye, the most common form of spam is that delivered in e-mail as a form of commercial advertising.&quot;<br />
In case the customers have requested these mails, it's not spam. If they haven't asked for them, it is spam.It's true, I'm not a spammer, this is a true business mailing list.  I hate spammers and I hope that anyone to receives this e-mail doesn't get pissed off (because if they get it they are going to get a discount for shopping here).  I work for a large bridal company and the e-mails are only for those who are getting married soon.<br />
<br />
BTW, thanks again, I did a test run sending an e-mail to several of mine and close friends e-mails and no one else saw the other e-mails. And it's good to see another Slackwareite out there who knows their stuff.  I run into many people who use *NIX and all say that slackware was too hard for them, and I laugh at them.  I won't go into why... I don't want to start a distro war.  I'm just happy to see more and more people using a superior OS every day.<br />
<br />
Thanks!oh cool, hehe, I never did bother to check and see that the &quot;BCC&quot; option meant. so I can put all e-mails in there and no one can see any one elses e-mail?  That's pretty cool.<br />
<br />
I've been using Slack for some time now, but it's always been server end, now I have to get workstation stuff going, so this is a big help. Thanks again, I'll be giving this a try.don't feed the troll behind the cagePlease don't use Linux for your Spamming needs.  Get a windows box for that...<br />

KCdid either of you notice that i answered his question, and that he doesn't appear to be a spammer?<br />
<br />
2000 emails is a drop in the bucket for a spammer, and some people do have legitimate reasons for sending so many out.  Haven't you ever managed a mailing list, or a Linux User Group, or software project?<br />

if BCC answered his question, then he isn't spamming.  give it a rest.use the &quot;BCC&quot; option in your mail client.  Every client has it, it stands for &quot;Blind Carbon Copy&quot;.  Recipients cannot see each other's addresses.This seams like a weird request, but I need it for work.  About every other month I get a list of e-mails that I must send promotional messages to.  Normally I would just copy and paste in Thunderbird and send em through my own mail server, but my boss doesn't want anyone to see the other e-mails the messages were sent to.  I can't send the messages one by one (there are about 2000 e-mails I have to have sent in like a week! I just started the job and the last guy had a lot of time to kill)<br />
<br />
Is there some way or a program I can use to send out one e-mail to thousands of people at once?  I've got the e-mail in standard text format seperated by a &lt;CR&gt; and the e-mail must be sent in HTML format.<br />
<br />
I'm running eXtremail and I have others running regular old sendmail. Using Slackware 9.1.<br />
<br />
Now, the big thing that makes this anoying. This place does NOT host their own mail server or website (yet). and I've got to make it look like the e-mail came from us or else most people will trash em, and the boss will be very very mad.<br />
<br />
Please, any help for me right now is good help!  Thanks!
