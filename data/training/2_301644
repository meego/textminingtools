What &quot;Protected&quot; means, I think, has something to do with permissions on the folder or program.<br />
<br />
What I think there saying here is don't restricked access to libogg it might need to use it sometime.<br />
<br />
You can make it to were no user or program can execute, read, and/or know if the program/folder exists even to the administrator (root).<br />
<br />
Go to libogg and check weather it is executable, readable, and acknowledgeable by at least root. If not change the permissions .<br />
<br />
If you don't have and window manager to do this in. Search the forums for a way to <u>change permissions with the CLI</u>-Command Line Interface (or  terminal).I'm installing KDevelop using YaST in SuSE 9.2.<br />
<br />
I've been notified that there is a dependency conflict.<br />
<br />
libogg 1.1-59 conflict<br />
- Required by:<br />
  - libogg-devel requires libogg = 1.1-<br />
- Conflict Resolution:<br />
 - Do Not Set libogg to Protected<br />
 - Ignore Conflict and Risk System Inconsistencies<br />
<br />
So I have a choice of not setting it to Protected - I don't even know what that means.<br />
Or<br />
Ignore the Conflict.<br />
<br />
I don't really see a problem here if I leave the 1.1-59 version that I installed earlier for MPlayer. I'd rather not downgrade if I don't have to. But, the wording on the two choices has me confused. <br />
<br />
Any clarification?
