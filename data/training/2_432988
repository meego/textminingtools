You would have been prompted for a username or password during the install. If you don't know it, try re-installing again - it may be the installer failed at some point before creating user accounts meaning the system likely wouldn't work anyways. Also, let us know what Linux distro (SuSE, Ubuntu, Mandriva, Fedora, etc.) it is you're trying to get installed so we can give you some extra pointers.I am new to this and i have installed the dvd and after reboot, it asks me for a LOGIN NAME and PASSWORD.<br />

I did not give any login name or password during installation and so what do I have to do now? or where can I get it?
