i recently updated everythign in gentoo and now when i try to use bittornado iget wxPython is either not installed or has not been installed properly. it worked before the update.Same problem here, thought it was only me :\. I think they might fix it later, so I'm using the ncurses interface for now...the only error message it gives me is that wxpython isnt installed or is installed incorrectly(Re)emerging wxGTK, wxpython and python itself did the trick for me.did yu haveit workingbefore. I went back to the version of bittornado i had working before and it still does it.if you guys still have this thread marked, could you tell me exactly what the command line spits back as the problem?
