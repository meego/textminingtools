Precise&amp;short! I love it!<br />
<br />
Thanks really much<br />
<br />
If anyone has other ideas,let me know.<br />
<br />
see yaHow I should manage a 80gb disk ,in a dual boot laptop, with Debian and WinXp?<br />
<br />
There are already two partitions in vfat format of about 40 gb each, the former is for WinXp.<br />
<br />
I have thought about two ways:<br />
-50/50, like it's now<br />
-more space for winxp, and I'd keep data in WinXp partition, creating a hard link to &quot;MyDoc&quot; dir in Linux, leaving in /home   only files necessary for my profile<br />
ex:/home/hamtavs/ /*all hidden folders*/<br />
/home/hamtavs/MyDoc--&gt;/mnt/hda1/documents..../MyDoc<br />
/*my personal data*/<br />
<br />
I hope I was clear<br />
<br />
