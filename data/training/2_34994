i can't seem to find any songs when searching, the bands i tried were pink floyd, nirvana, and others with no search results, is this me or does no one have these bands on this p2p network.Pink Floyd / Nirvana... well I've got them and I'm running gtk-gnutella, so at some point I imagine I will pop up on your list... just be patient.you probably haven't got enough hosts, or any gnutellanet connections. give it some time and you'll build up a more random hosts list.
