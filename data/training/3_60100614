They all use exactly the same core, give or take some L2 cache, only that X2 
<br />
and Opteron &gt;= 165 sport two cores, so an SMP-kernel makes a lot of sense 
<br />
there. Same for Turion64, Athlon64, Sempron64, Opteron.

Use an AMD64 kernel, with or without smp depending on core count. Depending on

the chipset I suggest 2.6.8 for sarge and AMD8000 chipset, for all newer

chipsets 2.6.12+ from unstable, for dual core the spanking newest kernel you

can get (see older thread below), eg. there's a 2.6.15 kernel in unstable.

Funny enough, the Athlon64 prices do not seem to drop very quickly. I

bought my 3000+ 939p for 109 Euro a year ago. Now it has been

that, because everything else in the PC has dropped in value

significantly.

I think it took a while for the word to travel that the Athlon64 are

indeed a revolution in performance. And AMD certainly made the most

out of it, in terms of money :-). I guess future prices will depend a

Like everything else its a judgement call, you can have your cake

<br />
I came over this problem about a week ago, I was going to just get a 
<br />
socket 754 sempron chip, and use it later down the road in a pvr. 
<br />

<br />
Almost everything was the same except the cost of the chip, the chip 
<br />
I really needed was over the two hundred dollar mark. As Myth TV 
<br />
likes it cpu power, if your working in 1080p.  Sure I could of got 
<br />
something less but then I have heard of people running into 
<br />
problems on 3200, 3400 Athlon 64's.  So I really needed a 3700 or 
<br />
better chip. In the end I ended up going for a Opteron 165, and as 
<br />
stated in another thread it only cost me about 60 dollars more than 
<br />
a single core 3700.
<br />

<br />
So for that price it was a good investment, as I know that demand 
<br />
will keep the dual cores prices up for a while until the next big 
<br />
thing.
