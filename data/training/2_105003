I tryed to google a bit and there are other versions like  compat-db-3.3.11-4.i386.rpm but not yours, perhaps you could try one other version. Anyway, good luck in your search.If anybody has the following rpm file &quot;compat-db-3.3-11.3.i386.rpm&quot;, could you kindly point it to me where i can get it.  This is the Berkeley DB database library for Redhat / i386<br />

I have searched throughout google and can't seem to find it at all.  I greatly appreciate any help.<br />

Thanks a lot<br />

it should be somewhere there.Unfortunately this particular rpm file seems to be the only one missing in all the servers. So I'm still back to square one
