What should i put to make it work with KDE desktops?well the VNC file obviously refers to the xinitrc file, but in your /etc/X11 directory. You are probably using the xinitrc in your home directory for your local sessions. Set the one in /etc/X11 to exec kde instead of gnome-session and all should be sweet.Hi:<br />

I managed to put VNC Server to work. I can access the linux box from my XP box without problems.<br />

The thing is that im getting GNOME Desktops instead of the KDE.<br />
<br />
Any ideas??<br />

Thanksedit your ~/.vnc/xstartup file. It acts as the xinitrc file, only for the VNC server. <br />
<br />
Note: by ~/ I mean the home directory of the user running the VNC server.<br />

By default it uses a crappy window manager, I prefer to set my VNC windowmanager to fvwm2, it is light weight, fast, and very functional.
