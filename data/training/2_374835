The Wine Application DB has someinfo on SoulSeek: <a href="http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?versionId=1244" target="_blank">SoulSeek @ Wiine App DB</a>  Hope that helps.<br />

BTW did you know there are 2 linux versions of this app available? They are: <a href="http://nicotine.thegraveyard.org/" target="_blank">Nicotine</a> and <a href="http://www.sensi.org/~ak/pyslsk/" target="_blank">PySoulSeek</a>im trying to run soulseek on wine, but when i run wine and select file &gt; execute and begin browsing my files it just exits without any error message after a few seconds. how do i make this not happen?no ideas? i did not configure anything at all.. i just installed and ran the program so maybe im overlooking something?thank you for the soulseek links : ) ineeded those, but im also partially just trying to get a relatively simple and useful program to run on wine just to see if i can.
