<b>Hi all<br />
I am wondering when I installed Mdk 10 , and when it boots , it shows that it has failed to bring interface eth0. How can I correct it? Is it one of the reason that I am not able to install the modem driver?<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

That is the message that I gget when I boot the machine though I am able to connect to the LAN at work. But I am not able to install HMR56 modem driver which I intend to use a t home. Eth0 failure might have nothing to do with modem driver installation. Everything was prefect when I was on Mdk 9.2 though,<br />
DO I need to configure something?<br />

Hello Punker,<br />
How do I do that? Just to tell you, I am able to connect to LAN with DHCP, so I hope doing as you have suggested, would not screw up that?<br />
