the mplayer source where they should be then............<br />
./configure<br />

su-(password) make installAh... Okay. Thanks...<br />
About the subs... Any solution?Hi... I've downloaded mplayer and the codecs in their page but the files that I downloaded had no install system. They were all *.dll or executable (but no way to execute them). In a post here someone said that the files should be copied to /usr/local/lib/codecs (created dir) however, my xmms (kaffeine) can't open my movies, only mplayer... How can I solve this?<br />
Another thing. In mplayer, I can't see subtitles. I have *.avi (movie) and *.sub (subtitle) but mplayer crashes when I try to open them... Can anyone help?
