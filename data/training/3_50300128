Grub has always expected the boot files to be in /boot, only the default

Fortunately /etc/kernel-img.conf allows one to turn of the creation of

those symlinks.

Haven't installed in a while, so not sure.

You used an outdated sid image. The fixed image was uploaded on the

The latest, preferably the sarge image.
